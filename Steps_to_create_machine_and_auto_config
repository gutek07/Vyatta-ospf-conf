1) Create VirtualMachine with the parameter: 
		Name: R1 
		Type: Linux 
		Version: Debian; 
		1 GB space on the VHD
		512 MB vram
2) Run "./Script1"

3) Install clear Vyatta on this machine with user "vyatta" and password "vyatta" and default settings.

4) Remove Vyatta-livecd from VCD-ROM

5) Run R1 machine and login as "vyatta" user and "vyatta" password

6) Execute command:
                    "config" press enter
			
		    "set service ssh" press enter
			
		    "set interfaces ethernet eth0 address dhcp" press enter
			
		    "commit" press enter
			
		    "save" press enter
			
		    
7) Run "./Script_2"

		    "exit" press enter
			
		    "poweroff" press enter
			
		    "yes" press enter

8) Run "./Script_3" - This script will create machine from topology.

9) Run machine R1, R2, R3, R4.

Now you have to run script to configuration each interfaces and protocol on the routers.

You cane do it by using ssh connection or directly on the machine.
    A_) By the ssh
	* execute on the router R1: 
		"ssh -p 2222 vyatta@127.0.0.1"		
		enter the password "vyatta"
		"./R1" 
		"configure"
		"load"
		"commit"

	* execute on the router R2: 
		"ssh -p 2222 vyatta@127.0.0.2"		
		enter the password "vyatta"
		"./R2" 
		"configure"
		"load"
		"commit"

	* execute on the router R3: 
		"ssh -p 2222 vyatta@127.0.0.3"		
		enter the password "vyatta"
		"./R3" 
		"configure"
		"load"
		"commit"

	* execute on the router R4: 
		"ssh -p 2222 vyatta@127.0.0.4"		
		enter the password "vyatta"
		"./R4" 
		"configure"
		"load"
		"commit"




    B_) By the directly on the machine
	* execute on the router R1 (in the home directly ~/):
		"./R1" 
		"configure"
		"load"
		"commit"

	* execute on the router R2 (in the home directly ~/):
		"./R2" 
		"configure"
		"load"
		"commit"

	* execute on the router R3 (in the home directly ~/):
		"./R3" 
		"configure"
		"load"
		"commit"

	* execute on the router R4 (in the home directly ~/):
		"./R4" 
		"configure"
		"load"
		"commit"

10) Run "./Script_4"
